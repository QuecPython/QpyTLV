## Overview

`TLV` stands for `Tag`, `Length` and `Value`, which is a data serialization format. It features a simple structure, fast parsing speed, supports nested messages, and sequential concatenation. It is commonly used in serial communication, Bluetooth, and even network data transmission.

`QpyTLV` is a TLV structure encoder and decoder written in the Quecpython language, which also supports EMV tags.
